# Introducing Bytes

Today I created a new [Bytes section](/Bytes) of the site.

The plan is for Bytes to be be short notes on code, journalism, etc. that don't merit a full blog post. The concept is inspired by [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) developer Simon Wilkinson's [TIL section](https://til.simonwillison.net/), which in turn was inspired by [Josh Branchaud's TIL GitHub](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/blob/master/README.md).

Once I've posted a few more Bytes, I can write a bigger blog post about them.
