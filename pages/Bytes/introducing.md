# Introducing Bytes

Today I posted my first 'byte' in the [Bytes section](/Bytes).

The plan is for bytes to be be short notes on code, journalism, etc. that don't merit a full blog post. The concept is inspired by [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) developer Simon Wilkinson's [TIL section](https://til.simonwillison.net/), which in turn was inspired by [Josh Branchaud's TIL GitHub](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/blob/master/README.md).

Once I've posted a few more bytes, I can write an actual blog post about them.
