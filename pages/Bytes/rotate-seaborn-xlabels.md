# Rotate x axis labels in Seaborn plot

When creating a plot with the [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) data visualization library for Python, labels on the x axis often overlap to the point of being unreadable:

We can fix this by rotating the labels 90Â° so that text displays vertically. This can be done by appending `.set_xticklabels(rotation=30)` to the end of the Seaborn grid object. 

E.g.

```python
sns.catplot(
    x="state",      
    y="count",  
    hue="candidate",
    data=visits,
    kind="bar",
).set_xticklabels(rotation=90)
```

For a much better result:
