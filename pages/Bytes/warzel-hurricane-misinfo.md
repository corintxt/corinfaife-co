# Charlie Warzel on our post-truth reality

In the Atlantic, writer **Charlie Warzel** [published a sobering piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/10/hurricane-milton-conspiracies-misinformation/680221/) on the overwhelming flood of conspiracy theories that have hampered the Hurricane Milton relief effort.

> The truth is, it’s getting harder to describe the extent to which a meaningful percentage of Americans have dissociated from reality," Warzel writes. "As Hurricane Milton churned across the Gulf of Mexico last night, I saw an onslaught of outright conspiracy theorizing and utter nonsense racking up millions of views across the internet.

In a natural disaster, this isn't just deceptive, but downright dangerous. FEMA workers have found their work hampered by people who have consumed this misinformation; emergency first responders are wasting valuable time combatting rumors online.

Warzel later quotes Michael Caulfield at the University of Washington [who says that](https://mikecaulfield.substack.com/p/copium-addicts-what-misinformation) *"The primary use of ‘misinformation’ is not to change the beliefs of other people at all. Instead, the vast majority of misinformation is offered as a service for people to maintain their beliefs in face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary."*

It's a depressing piece, but one of the better recent analyses of our current disfunctional information ecosystem.
