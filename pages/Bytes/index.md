# Bytes

'Bytes' are short notes on code and/or life that don't merit a full blog post. The concept was inspired by [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) developer Simon Wilkinson's [TIL section](https://til.simonwillison.net/), which in turn was inspired by Josh Branchaud's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/blob/master/README.md).
