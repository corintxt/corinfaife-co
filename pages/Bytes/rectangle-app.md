# Rectangle app for Mac window management

For many years now my personal laptop has run **Ubuntu Linux**, while recently my work laptop has been a **Mac**.

Though I've slowly come around to liking Macs, I missed using all of the customizable [window management shortcuts](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/shell-windows.html.en) that Ubuntu provides. (I heard somewhere that Mac is not allowed to implement these shortcuts natively due to Microsoft holding the patents for its Windows system, but am not totally sure if that's true.)

I discovered (way too late) that there are a range of third-party apps for Mac that replicate this kind of functionality. Personally I just started using [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/), but have also seen people recommend [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12). 

Wish I'd looked into this sooner!
