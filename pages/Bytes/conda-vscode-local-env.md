# Create and activate a conda env in VSCode

The VSCode command palette (accessed with ⌘ + ⇧ + P) gives the user an option to create a Python environment, including a conda environment, in the current directory.

This environment can then be activated by referencing the path to the environment where one would usually put the environment name, e.g. `conda activate myenv`.

So the command to activate an environment by path might look like:

```
conda activate /Users/Corin/Code/MyDataProject/.conda
```
