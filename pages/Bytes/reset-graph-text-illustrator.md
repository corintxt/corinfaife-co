# Reset graph text in Adobe Illustrator

 The graph creator tool in Adobe Illustrator has a lot of quirks. One of them is that scaling a chart in a non-uniform way, i.e. making it either taller or wider, also scales the chart text in the same way.

To reset font scaling back to normal: 
* Press `a` to enable the direct selection tool
* Select the relevant text
* Press `Shift`+`âŒ˜`+`x`. 

The text will return to its original width/height proportions.
