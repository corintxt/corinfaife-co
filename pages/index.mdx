# Corin Faife

## Hi.

### I'm a reporter who likes to use code, data and graphics to tell stories.

Currently I'm a data journalist at global news agency [Agence France-Presse](https://www.afp.com/en),
where I work in the data and visualisation department to cover US news for an international audience. 
You can find some of the background to my work in the [Blog](/posts) section of this site.

Previously I was senior cybersecurity correspondent [at The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/authors/corin-faife), and a data reporter [at The Markup](https://themarkup.org/people/corin-faife), an investigative newsroom focused on Big Tech. 
Links to my reporting for both of these outlets (and more) is in the [Portfolio](/portfolio) section.

I also worked at global nonprofit [WITNESS](https://www.witness.org/) researching deepfakes and AI-driven media manipulation, and was the [inaugural Peggy J. Koenig Civic Innovation Fellow](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/members/Faife) at Cornell Tech university.

Use the details below to say hello.
