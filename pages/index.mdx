# Corin Faife

I'm a journalist interested in technology, politics, and the politics of technology.

After starting my career in London, then moving to Montreal, I'm now based in New York where I attended the Recurse Center programming retreat in 2019.

Since then I've worked at global nonprofit WITNESS researching deepfakes and media manipulation, at The Markup on the Citizen Browser Facebook accountability project, and as a senior reporter at The Verge covering privacy, surveillance and cybersecurity.

Currently I'm the inaugural Peggy J. Koenig Civic Innovation Fellow at Cornell Tech university, based at the Digital Life Initiative under the supervision of Professor Helen Nissenbaum.

Use the details below to say hello.
