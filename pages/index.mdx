# Corin Faife

## Hi.

### I'm a reporter who likes to use code, data and graphics to tell stories.

Currently I'm a data journalist at the global news agency [Agence France-Presse](https://www.afp.com/en),
where I work in the graphics department to cover the North America region, and also build newsroom tools. 

Previously I was senior cybersecurity correspondent [at The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/authors/corin-faife), and a data reporter [at The Markup](https://themarkup.org/people/corin-faife), an investigative newsroom focused on Big Tech. 
Links to my reporting for both of these outlets (and more) can be found in the [Portfolio](/portfolio) section.

I also worked at nonprofit [WITNESS](https://www.witness.org/) researching deepfakes and AI-driven media manipulation, and was the [inaugural Peggy J. Koenig Civic Innovation Fellow](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/members/Faife) at Cornell Tech university.

You can read some of the documentation behind my work in the [Technical blog](/posts) section of this site, 
and find ongoing notes on learning in the [Bytes](/Bytes) section. 

Or, use the details below to say hello.
