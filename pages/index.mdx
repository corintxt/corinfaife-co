# Corin Faife

## Hi.

### I'm a journalist interested in technology, politics, and the politics of technology. 

### I also like to use code and data to tell stories.

Currently I'm the first US-based data journalist at the global news agency Agence France-Presse. Previously I was senior cybersecurity correspondent [at The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/authors/corin-faife), and a data reporter [at The Markup](https://themarkup.org/people/corin-faife) working on the Citizen Browser Facebook accountability project.

I've also worked at global nonprofit [WITNESS](https://www.witness.org/) researching deepfakes and AI-driven media manipulation, and was the [inaugural Peggy J. Koenig Civic Innovation Fellow](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/members/Faife) at Cornell Tech university.

After starting my career in London, then moving to Montreal, I'm now based in New York where I attended the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/) programming retreat in spring 2019 and summer 2023.

Use the details below to say hello.
