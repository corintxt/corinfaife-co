# Corin Faife

I'm a journalist interested in technology, politics, and the politics of technology.

After starting my career in London, then moving to Montreal, I'm now based in New York where I attended the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/) programming retreat in spring 2019 and summer 2023.

In that time I've worked at global nonprofit [WITNESS](https://www.witness.org/) researching deepfakes and media manipulation, [at The Markup](https://themarkup.org/people/corin-faife) on the Citizen Browser Facebook accountability project, and as a [senior reporter at The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/authors/corin-faife) covering privacy, surveillance and cybersecurity.

Currently I'm the [inaugural Peggy J. Koenig Civic Innovation Fellow](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/members/Faife) at Cornell Tech university, based at the Digital Life Initiative under the supervision of Professor Helen Nissenbaum.

Use the details below to say hello.
