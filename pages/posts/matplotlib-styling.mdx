# Some matplotlib styling tips

As a data journalist at AFP, my workflow often involves using Python for data analysis and exploratory visualization, then handing over the results to a graphic designer as an SVG file to be finished for publication. 

I've slowly been making tweaks to the matplotlib styling to reduce the gap between what I hand over and a publishable graphic in AFP house style. 

So we can go from this:

To this:

Here's a breakdown of the styling tweaks needed.

### Set chart size and line width
AFP's two-column graphic layout corresponds to a 6x4 image ratio, which we define before drawing the chart:

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
```
We'll then draw a simple line chart following the example above –– US voter turnout over time. When we draw the chart we'll want to increase the line width slightly.
```
plt.plot(df['YEAR'],
         df['TURNOUT_RATE_PRES'],
          linewidth=2)
```

### Remove frame, calibrate axes

We're going to do a lot of the chart styling by modifying attributes of the [Axes object](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes).

First we call the `.gca()` function to *get current axes* of the plot and assign the reference to a variable. We can then use various methods of the [axes api](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/axes_api.html) to modify plot characteristics, like setting the frame on or off:

```
ax = plt.gca()
ax.set_frame_on(False)
```

We're also going to override the default Y axis limits to make sure that we have a value marker above the highest value and below the lowest value of the line. 

```
ax.set_ylim([0.44, 0.75])
```
While we're working on the Y axis, we'll also want to change the decimal score to a percentage. We do this by first getting a reference to the Y ticks, then using Python's `format()` function to [display the decimal string as percent](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5306756/how-to-print-a-percentage-value).

```
ticks = ax.get_yticks()
ax.set_yticklabels(['{:,.0%}'.format(x) for x in ticks])
```

### Style grid lines and ticks
AFP line charts and column charts generally use dashed full-width grid lines on the Y axis of the chart. 

First we'll switch off the y axis ticks, and tuck the x axis ticks closer to the chart. Then we'll [draw a full width custom grid line](https://e2eml.school/matplotlib_ticks#grid) in grey:

```
plt.tick_params(axis='y', left=False)
plt.tick_params(axis='x', length=5, direction='in', )

ax.grid(axis="y", 
        color="grey", 
        alpha=.5, 
        linewidth=.5, 
        linestyle="--")
```

### Define title, subtitle, and footnote

AFP charts dispaly a title, usually a subheading, and always include a source attribution. 

To approximate the house style we can use matplotlib's [rcParams](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/matplotlib_configuration_api.html#default-values-and-styling) settings to choose a font, in this case Adobe's [Source Sans](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-sans). We'll also set `svg.fonttype` to `none`, which instructs matplotlib not to convert text into paths when saving an SVG.

```
plt.rcParams.update(
                {'font.family': 'Source Sans Pro',
                "svg.fonttype": 'none'
                })
```
Then we'll use `plt.suptitle()` ('super title') for the main heading, and `title()` for the subheading. 

We need to set x and y values to position each of these correctly, though this can be confusing because each one uses a different reference system – `suptitle()` needs a y value of 1 or greater to appear at the top of the chart, whereas `title()` is at the top by default:

```
plt.suptitle("US election turnout",
             x=0.1,
             y=1.02,
             fontsize=20, 
             fontweight='bold',
             ha='left')
plt.title("Voter turnout in the 2024 election was still among the highest since 1900",
          x= -.03,
          pad=15,
          fontsize=10,
          fontweight='semibold',
          ha='left',
          )
```
Lastly we use `plt.figtext()` to add a footnote with the source. As with `suptitle()`, we're giving [x,y] positioning coordinates from the bottom left of the figure.
```
plt.figtext(0.1, 0.01, 
            "Source: UF Election Lab", 
            ha="left", 
            fontsize=8)
```

And here's the finished result again:
